# DroidHub

DroidHub is a simple app that lets users store their files in cloud storage, view and be able to downoad them.
The app uses MVVM architecture
I used the following developemnt components

* ViewBinding - for easy interaction between code and views
* ViewModel - manage UI's data in a lifecycle-aware fashion

#### Prerequisite
